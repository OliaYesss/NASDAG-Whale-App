# NASDAQ Whale App

## Discription

NASDAQ Whale App provides quick access to real-time market data (stock quotes). NASDAQ opening time always refers to the beginning of normal hours or 9.30 AM to 4 PM (ET) on all working days. Trading does not happen on Saturdays and Sundays so NASDAQ Whale app won't receive any data at that time.
